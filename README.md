# MotMysTerm

## Description

MotMysTerm is a terminal-based game written in C that lets you play the popular French word game *Sutom* directly in your terminal. The objective is to guess the secret word within a limited number of attempts. Each word must match the correct length, and after each guess, you get feedback showing which letters are correctly placed or present in the word.

This project brings the fun of *Sutom* into a simple terminal interface, making it a great challenge for word game enthusiasts and C programmers alike.
